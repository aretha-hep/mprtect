2013-05-01  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 0.5.0

	* Converting build system to just use distutils: there's no real
	need for the autotools wrapper anymore.

2013-03-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing ParticleDataTable, etc. so that compilation will still
	work with HepMC >= 2.06

2009-04-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding $(DESTDIR) prefix to call to Python module "setup.py
	install"

2009-03-04  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Adding SWIG type table name.

2009-01-07  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed build system *again*, since SWIG on SL cannot handle
	elements of the HepMC C++ headers (even after hacking to make
	Python 2.3 distutils support SWIG properly). The build now assumes
	that tarballs are being made on a machine with a good version of
	SWIG, and requires no SWIG to be installed on the target system.

2009-01-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed build system to use newer Python support m4 macros from
	cryp.to archive.

2008-12-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed build system to use distutils/setuptools rather than m4
	macros for most things. There is a problem in the distutils SWIG
	support that currently breaks the distcheck target.

2008-10-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Mapping pair<GenParticle*,GenParticle*>

	* Added GenEvent.summary() method in Python.

2008-10-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added stdin/stdout reading and writing of HepMC data to the SWIG
	remapping of the IO_GenEvent constructor.
